# Python - Spreadsheet Analysis
During my "Python & Apps" project, I used the Python programming language to analyse a Kaggle database related to a company's sales and expenditure.

As part of the project, I created code for the following tasks:

- Read the data from the CSV file
- Collect all the sales from each month into a single list
- Output the total sales across all months
- Calculate monthly changes as a percentage, average, and identify the months with the highest and lowest sales
- Visualise the data using bar charts (Sales per month, Expenditure per month)

Outcome: The company had the highest sales in July and the lowest in February. The highest expenditure was in March and the lowest in April.
