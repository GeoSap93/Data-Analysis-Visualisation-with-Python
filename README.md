# Python- Spreadsheet Analysis 

During my "Python & Apps" project I used Python programming language to analyse a Kaggle database, regarding a company's sales and expenditure.

As part of the project I created code for the following tasks:
1. Read the data from the csv file
2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
3. Output the total sales across all months
4. Calculating monthly changes as a persentage, average, months with the highest and lowest sales
5. Visualization of data by using bar chart graph (Sales per month, Expenditure per month)
   
   Outcome: The company had the highest sales in July and the lowest in February.
            The highest expenditure was in March and lowest in April.
